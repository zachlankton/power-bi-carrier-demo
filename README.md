# Power BI Carrier Demo

This is my first Power BI Visual that I made as a demo for a friend.

It's primary purpose was to be a table with clickable rows that would expand into a details view.

To setup up you drag the columns that you want in the table into the `Summary` section and the columns that you want in the details view into the `Details` section.

This will result in a table like so:

# Development

then run

```
pbiviz start
```

# Build and Package

Run:

```
pbiviz package

the custom viz will be in the `dist` folder. You can then [import the custom visual into power bi using that file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/import-visual)â€‹
